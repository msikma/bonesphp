Bones Framework â€“ Microscopic MVC Framework for PHP
===================================================

This is an extremely simple example of an MVC framework for PHP. It could serve
as an educational sample, or you could use it in a real site if you don't like
your framework to do anything for you except basic MVC scaffolding.

Twig support is built in if you get the Git submodule for it.

There's some example content in the `application/` directory.
